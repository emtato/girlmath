formatting requirements for inputs


1. quiz:
question_code is a unique identifier for each question ("confidence", "feel", "motivation", "[custom defined tracking metric]", etc)
we can have a table to properly map out what each word corresponds to, but this is the best way i can think of to identify questions

{
    quiz: {
        question_code: number[1-10],
        question_code: number[1-10],
        ...
    }
    yesterday_goal: 1 or 0,
    tomorrow: str,
    date: unix timestamp
}

example:
{
  "quiz": {
    "confidence": 7,
    "motivation": 4,
    "focus": 6
  },
  "yesterday_goal": 1,
  "tomorrow": "finish lab",
  "date": 1706668800
}
